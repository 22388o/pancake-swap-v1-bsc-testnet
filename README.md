# Pancake Swap V1 on BSC Testnet
This repo contains all source code of Pancake Swap. It has modified to run on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Testnet.
<br />My original purpose is to use it to test my DApps that connect to Pancake Swap. Using the BSC Testnet environment has helped me a lot in reducing the cost and time of DApps development. I found it very useful for developers so I shared this version.

<p>If you want to use Pancake Swap v1 on BSC Testnet, please to the link: https://pancake.kiemtienonline360.com/
<br />If you want to implement your own Pancake Swap, please see detailed instructions below.

# Step by step to deploy Pancake Swap V1
<ul>
  <li><b>Step 1</b>: Deploy Pancake Factory Contract</li>
  <li><b>Step 2</b>: Deploy Pancake Router Contract</li>
  <li><b>Step 3</b>: Deploy Pancake Swap Interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these three steps, step 3 will take the longest time, step 2 need for a little attention. It takes time for me, but I will guide you how to deploy them in just 10 minutes.
